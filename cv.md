## About Me

#### Started learning programming at the university and immediately fell in love with it. I spend all my free time trying to learn something new and never get tired of it.

#### I have a burning desire to become a web programmer, so I have good basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4. I also have experience with JavaScript, and it's framework React. I also learn PHP, I made my last CourseWork using PHP framework Laravel and I also have my own pet project which is being made using this framework [TDLabs](https://github.com/vangaru/TDLabs). Frankly speaking this project is not ready. I'd like to add that I have experience with Docker, npm and Git. I worked with databases, so I'm rather good at SQL and MySQL

#### I have read such books as *Complete Code (Steve McConnell)*, *Clean Code(Robert Martin)*, *Grokking Algorithms*, *Computer Systems And Networks(Andrew Tanenbaum)*, *Head First Design Patterns*. I think that I need to reread some of these books to understand them completely.

#### I am a second-year Brest State Technical University student of the faculty of the electronic information systems. My specialization is software development.

#### I rate my knowledge of English as a little higher than intermediate due to the fact that I studied in an advanced English class at school. I took an English after-school centralized test and got 81 points, also recently I took lexical-grammatical test, and it showed me that I have C1 level. Frankly speaking I don't have a clue if this test is correct enough to believe its results.
